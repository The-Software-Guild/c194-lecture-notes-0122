# C194 Front End Development - 0122

## Overview

This repository will serve as your center for all lecture portions of the Front End Development C194 course provided by MThree Global in January 2022. Please see the [instructions](#instructions) below for a more detailed walkthrough of how to use the repository.

## Instructions

To start the course please clone down the entire repository to yourt local machine. We will be switching branches for each new days lecture. Lecture note branches will be broken up by topic and then by day.

     ex) node-day0-start

Each day's lecture notes will then be broken up by ```start``` and ```end``` suffixed to the ```topic-day#``` syntax â€” referring to what branch you should be switching to in order to begin your day (start) and what you should be switching to at the end of the day (end). ```-end``` day notes will contain any of my notes from the lecture, any questions we went over, example work we go through during the lecture, and any other extra content I feel is needed for additional supplemental material.
