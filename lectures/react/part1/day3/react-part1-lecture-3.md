#### Testing

##### **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**

TDD refers to a style of programming in which three activities are tightly interwoven: coding, testing (in the form of writing **unit tests**) and design (in the form of refactoring).

It can be succinctly described by the following set of rules:

- write a **single** unit test describing an aspect of the program

- run the test, which should fail because the program lacks that feature

- write **just enough** code, the simplest possible, to make the test pass

- **refactor** the code until it conforms to the simplicity criteria

- repeat, **accumulating** unit tests over time
