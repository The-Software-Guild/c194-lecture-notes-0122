### 1. Node.js => Node Patterns and Modularization

Node is a server side JS runtime env ... allowing use of JS on computer not in browser (v8 engine = chrome)

#### 3 Types of Modules

1) External/3rd Party - installed via NPM
2) Node Core Modules - intentially minimal built in (no need to install). Includes path, fs, OS, util, and more.
3) File Based - within our own application, using a pattern of module.exports and require.

Similar to es6 import/export.
