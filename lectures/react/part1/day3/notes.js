// testing
// many unit tests comprises a singular functionality and then many functionalities comprise a larger unit of measuremant
// end to end testing 

// write our tests first 

// TDD
// FPR

// tests act as documentation => should ultimately infer the code you end up writing 
// (something should or should Not hapen) {
     // mock up and do that something to prove your assertion
// }


// assessment-1-node
// section-1
// inability to showcase the functions you created
// inability to discuss your solution in any way
// need to have a testign function that showcases the solution and handles all edge cases


// inconsistent syntax and naming conventions
// const let 
// var

// time-complexities
// "hello" // olleh


// user-centric deisgn

// section-2
// vanilla JS DOM interaction events

// 2 way data binding is the basis for vue.js
// mousemove 
// submit (appending html elements to the DOM) => create HTML progrmatically with JS

// section-3
// generally was okay except for some complete lack of testing which following TDD
// a complete unfinished route like just no update or no query
// not use express-router (left server.js really busy)

// react-refactor 

// pull requests === production ready code

// “Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. 
// Good programmers write code that humans can understand.” – Martin Fowler

// write tons of comments

// Once a section has been completed:
// - prepare your code to ‘push to production’ 
// by: removing all extra development logs and unnecessary commented out code or comments, 
// format the code according to your style guidelines, and refactor where and if necessary.
// - push final code to your repo and set up a code review via Calendly with me
// - prepare to defend your code in the code review: think of your solutions in 
// terms of efficiency (BigO), are there any edge cases you have not thought of and do they need to be addressed, 
// think of why you chose to do things a certain way or if you got stuck somewhere and created a unique solution 
// be ready to discuss why you made that choice, ...etc.
// - During the code review you may be asked to alter or expand on 
// your code some come prepared with all files and folders open in your IDE ready to be shown and worked on.
// - Remember to think out loud always, take your time when presented with new questions, up to an extent 
// feel free to bounce questions or ideas of your reviewer, don’t get to stressed out if things aren’t going your way 
// — writing bad code does not make you a bad programmer, it makes you human.

// You are not the code you write
