// ReactDOM.render()

// SPA
// Single Page Applications

// components (class vs functional)
// props are attributes of components that allow us to
// transfer data from one component to another 
// parent to child, this is done where the component 
// is rendered and passed down through our hierarchy



// can ONLY render a singular node (child)
// the workaround for this is often to wrap children in a div
// this leads to a problem called wrapper hell
// the fix for this is to use react fragments (React.Fragment -or- <> </>)
// it allows for groupings of children without the unecesary addition of an extra DOM node (aka a div wrapper)

// props
