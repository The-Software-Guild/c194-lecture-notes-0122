// lists & keys
// when displaying lists of things or items you need a "key" property 
// this key proeprty tells react what children are unique in order to better keep track of them
// during reconcilliation (diffing algorthim)
// the uniqueness needs only to be that of the group and not global
// if you dont do this react will actually include a key for you by just using the index of that array for each key
