### 1. Day 0 Review

### 2. Introduction to Agile Project Management

To understand Agile Software development we must look no further than the, "Manifesto for Agile Software Devlopment." The Manifesto states:

We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.

Through this work we have come to value:

**_Individuals and interactions_** over processes and tools

**_Working software_** over comprehensive documentation

**_Customer collaboration_** over contract negotiation

**_Responding to change_** over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

For a deeper dive into Agile practices take a look into the [12 Principles of Agile Software Development](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html), or [Atlassian's Agile documentation](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management)

### 3. Kanban vs. Scrum

"Kanban vs. scrum” is a discussion about two different strategies for implementing an agile development or project management system. Kanban methodologies are continuous and more fluid, whereas scrum is based on short, structured work sprints

    Agile is a set of ideals and principles that serve as our north star. DevOps is a way to automate and integrate the processes between software development and operations teams. When implementing agile and DevOps, kanban and scrum provide different methodologies for managing complex work.

It's easy to point out the differences between scrum practices and kanban practices, but that's just at the surface level. While the practices differ, the principles are largely the same. Both frameworks will help you build better products (and services) with fewer headaches.

#### **What is Scrum?**

While the Scrum I’m talking about is most frequently used by software development teams, its principles and lessons can be applied to all kinds of teamwork. This is one of the reasons Scrum is so popular. Often thought of as an agile project management framework, Scrum describes a set of meetings, tools, and roles that work in concert to help teams structure and manage their work.

    Scrum is a framework that helps teams work together. Much like a rugby team (where it gets its name) training for the big game, Scrum encourages teams to learn through experiences, self-organize while working on a problem, and reflect on their wins and losses to continuously improve.

Scrum teams commit to ship working software through set intervals called sprints. Their goal is to create learning loops to quickly gather and integrate customer feedback. Scrum teams adopt specific roles, create special artifacts, and hold regular ceremonies to keep things moving forward. Scrum is best defined in [The Scrum Guide](https://scrumguides.org/).

#### **Kanban**

Kanban is all about visualizing your work, limiting [work in progress](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban/wip-limits), and maximizing efficiency (or flow). Kanban teams focus on reducing the time it takes to take a project (or [user story](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/user-stories)) from start to finish. They do this by using a [kanban board](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban/boards) and continuously improving their flow of work.

    Japanese for Sign Board, Kanban is a popular framework used to implement agile and DevOps software development. It requires real-time communication of capacity and full transparency of work. Work items are represented visually on a kanban board, allowing team members to see the state of every piece of work at any time.
