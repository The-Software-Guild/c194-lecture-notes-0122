# C165 Week 0 Vanilla JS Lecture 2

Learning goals for week 0 day 2 => We are collectively solidifying our base knowledge of JS in order to move into more advanced concepts in the coming week.

## Agenda

1) Day 1 Recap
2) Vanilla JS Overview
3) JS Quiz
4) Leetcode & Edabit

### 1. Day 1 Review

- Agile PM
- Scrum vs Kanban (_see-assets_)

### 2. Vanilla JS Overview

Lousely typed dynamic scripting language.

[syntax](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)

    nouns & verbs

#### **Values**

_Primitive Values_

- Numbers
- Strings
- Booleans, used for logical operations.

- Undefined, used for unintentionally missing values.
- Null, used for intentionally missing values.

- BigInt
- Symbolk, used to hide implementation details.

**Primitive values are immutable (unchangeable/read only)!**

_Objects and Functions_

- Objects ({} and others), used to group related data and code.
- Functions (x => x * 2 and others), used to refer to code.

Functions in JS are explicitly returned. JS has 1st class functions, which means:

1) Store fx's as values

2) Pass around fx's as arguments

3) Fx's can be returned from other fx's

Function Invocation

1) FX Style

2) Method Style

3) Constructor Style

**No Other Types**

#### **Expressions**

Expressions are questions that JavaScript can answer. JavaScript answers expressions in the only way it knows how — with values.

If we “ask” the expression 2 + 2, JavaScript will “answer” with the value 4.

```Javascript
console.log(2 + 2); // 4
```

If the word “expression” confuses you, think of it as a piece of code that expresses a value. You might hear people say that 2 + 2 “results in” or “evaluates to” 4. These are all different ways to say the same thing.

We ask JavaScript 2 + 2, and it answers with 4. **Expressions always result in a single value**.

#### **Variables**

Variables are not values.

Variables point to values.

_Declaratios & Assignment_

_Var vs. Let vs. Const_
